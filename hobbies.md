I've been trying to read more for pleasure lately. I'm reading Frank Herbert's "Dune" for the first time right now and I'm really enjoying it

My partner and I also LOVE our trash reality TV. She got me hooked on The Bachelor/ette, we watch Master Chef religiously, and are so obsessed with game shows that we've applied to be on Supermarket Sweep and I've applied to audition for Jeopardy about a half-dozen times at this point.
